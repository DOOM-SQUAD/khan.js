  # @t is the current time (or position) of the tween. This can be
  #   seconds or frames, steps, seconds, ms, whatever â€“ as long as
  #   the unit is the same as is used for the total time [3].
  # @b is the beginning value of the property.
  # @c is the change between the beginning and destination value of the property.
  # @d is the total time of the tween.
  #
  # only the t is changed.
  #
  # every last one of these is flat out copied from the penner equations
